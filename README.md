# Oh-No-Dino
Be a starving dino in the forest. Avoid trees while eating unicorns.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- game has one dinosaure that moves horizontally
- trees appear randomly from the top of the screen
- collision between the dino and a tree will end the game with error message 'no no'
- unicorns appear randomly rom the top of the screen
- collision between the dino and a unicorn will increase scoreboard by 1 point
- scoreboard increasing for each unicorns eaten
